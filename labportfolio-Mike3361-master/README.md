# LabRepository

This repository will act as a porfolio for your lab work. For each lab (that is not a MOLE quiz) you will be expected to commit your exercises to this repository.

To do so, create a separate directory for each week:

Week1

Week2

Week3

...

Week10

You are expected to commit all of the files (text, source code, diagrams, etc.) within one week of the lab session. You should absolutely avoid the situation where you have to work on multiple lab-exercises at the same time.
